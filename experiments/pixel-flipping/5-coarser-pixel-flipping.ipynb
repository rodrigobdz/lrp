    "In [3-fine-grained-pixel-flipping](./3-fine-grained-pixel-flipping.ipynb), we showed a functioning POC of the Pixel-Flipping algorithm. Areas to improve were that evaluating the function after every pixel flip was too costly and in this next iteration, we should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fix bugs in the algorithm (relevance scores were wrongly updated)\n",
    "- Improve syntax of algorithm (use masks to select the input values to flip, use a function to hide the details of the algorithm and make it more reusable)\n",
    "- Evaluate the decay of the class accuracy after multiple flipsâ€”i.e., use patches instead of single pixels."
